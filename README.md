## Overview
The goal of this project is not just to perform a simplistic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) or to develop the best Machine Learning model, but rather to dive deep into the dataset and explore it in a curiosity-based manner. The primary objective is to uncover insights and understand the data as thoroughly as possible.

## Curiosity-based Approach
In a curiosity-based approach, we adopt a mindset of continuous inquiry and exploration. Instead of just skimming the surface with basic analyses, we actively seek to understand the nuances and intricacies of the dataset. Here's how the curiosity-based process unfolds:

General Exploratory Analysis: We start by conducting a general exploratory analysis, examining variable types, dataframe size, general statistics, and missing values. This serves as our initial dive into the dataset.

Questioning and Inquiry: As we delve into the data, we inevitably encounter various patterns, anomalies, and interesting observations. Instead of passively accepting these findings, we actively question and inquire about them. Every insight sparks new questions, leading to deeper exploration.

Iterative Exploration: The exploration process becomes iterative, with each question leading to further investigation and discovery. As we answer one question, new questions emerge, propelling us into deeper layers of understanding.

Thorough Understanding: The ultimate goal is to gain a thorough understanding of the dataset. By continuously questioning, exploring, and seeking answers, we aim to uncover hidden insights and patterns that may not be apparent at first glance.

Documentation and Sharing: Throughout the exploration journey, we document our findings, insights, and unanswered questions. This documentation serves as a record of our exploration process and can be shared with others to facilitate collaborative analysis and learning.

## Conclusion
By embracing a curiosity-based approach, we go beyond surface-level analysis and strive for a deeper understanding of the dataset. Through continuous questioning and exploration, we uncover valuable insights and gain new perspectives, enriching our overall analysis and decision-making process.
